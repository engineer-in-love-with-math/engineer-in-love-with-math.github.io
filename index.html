        <h1>Hello, I'm Kshitij Anand.</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my public address on the internet.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="intro">
        <p>According to the conventional definitions, I am a PhD student at Aeronautics, Dynamics and Controls Laboratory in the Department of Mechancial and Aerospace Engineering at UC Irvine. The fault in my stars is clear, I am a person who admires engineering and loves math religiously at the same time. My affection to math, does not mean I am an expert in math. I am trying to be. However, math is extremely tough but you know the truth or you don't. There is no scope for whimsical arbitration. Unfortunately, the latter represents the majority of jobs that exist today. It is only okay if AI replaces such jobs and we start to focus more on what we love to do and want to do, rather than merely try to survive. </p>
